## Overview

Briefly describe your project and its goals here. Highlight the significance of food image recognition and the problem your project solves. Mention any unique features or approaches you've taken.

## Getting Started

In this section, provide instructions on how to get started with your project. Include steps for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the code. You can also mention any hardware requirements, if applicable.

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites that users need to have installed before they can use your project. This might include Python, TensorFlow, Keras, or any other specific libraries.

```bash
# Example:
# - Python 3.7 or higher
# - TensorFlow 2.0
# - Keras
```

### Installation

Provide detailed installation instructions, including any specific commands or scripts users should run to set up the project environment. You can also include code snippets for virtual environment creation and package installation.

```bash
# Example:
# 1. Create a virtual environment
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

Explain the dataset you used for your project, including its source and purpose. Mention any data preprocessing steps that were performed, such as resizing, data augmentation, or normalization.

## Model Architecture

Describe the architecture of the EfficientNetB3 model and how it was used in your project. Explain the concept of transfer learning and precision training.

Include code snippets or diagrams if they help in understanding the model architecture.

```python
# Example:
# Load EfficientNetB3 model with pre-trained weights
from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB3

model = EfficientNetB3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
```

## Usage

Provide clear instructions on how to use your project. Include examples of how to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate performance. You can also include sample code or Jupyter notebooks for users to follow along.

```bash
# Example:
# 1. Train the model
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32

# 2. Make predictions
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
```
