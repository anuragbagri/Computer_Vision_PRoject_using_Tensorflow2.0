Project Goals
Accurate Food Classification: Our primary goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify a wide variety of food items from images.

Efficient Model: We have chosen the EfficientNetB3 architecture, known for its balance of accuracy and efficiency, as the backbone for our model.

Transfer Learning: We take advantage of transfer learning by initializing our model with pre-trained weights on a large dataset, allowing us to achieve excellent results with relatively little data.

Precision Training: In addition to transfer learning, we implement precision training techniques to further improve model performance and reduce training time.
